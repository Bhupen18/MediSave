                    <h3>RISING COST OF MEDICAL TREATMENT</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Healthcare costs are sky-rocketing, and the current pandemic situation has fueled the inflation of medical care costs. Not being able to avail high-quality medical care due to poor financial conditions is one of the common situations in the country. A health insurance plan can help to cope up with such scenarios.Now, the first question on your mind would be, why are healthcare costs increasing despite the emergence of advanced technology? The advanced technology has only reduced the time taken for certain medical treatments, but the costs continue to creep up. In India, the rate of medical inflation stands at 15% per annum compared to 6-7% overall inflation per year.</p>

                    <h3>COMPARE MEDICAL COST</h3>
                    <p>The costs of medical and health care services have been rising steadily for many years, and American consumers are feeling the pinch in a big way. Many American individuals and families are now facing extremely high medical debts, some of them for reasonably routine or minor health care procedures or treatments. With the private insurance system looking to offset costs, and very little in the way of a safety net for consumers, medical bankruptcy threatens many thousands of families each year.

                      What new reports are showing is that a great way to shop around for health care is to ask your insurance company. Big insurers make most of the efforts at cataloging the various rates that different providers charge for services like CIGNA, Anthem Blue Cross, and other multi-state insurance companies. Patients can also ask their insurance company which providers have a contractual plan that forces them to charge a certain set price for a given medical service. Another way to compare medical cost by using an online service that can compare these costs for you, such as MediFees.com. MediFees.com is a health transparency start-up that has recently acquired healthcare start-up Mediskore.com.</p>

                    <h3>IMAGIN COST</h3>
                    
                    <p>Many procedures and treatments have significant pricing disparities throughout medical facilities nationwide. Other major cost disparities that are less complex regarding overall costs are imaging services (CT Scan, X-ray etc) offered by medical facilities. Imaging costs and services are more cut and dry, therefore easier to breakdown data and determine the cost of service down to the penny. More importantly, these are relatively the same diagnostic machines doing the same work with the help of an experienced and trained professional. Yet, when it comes to a fixed price the cost disparity for imaging services from one medical facility to another widely differs.   More states now than ever are reporting exclusively on the cost of healthcare and disparities (all payer claims database e.g.), and I anticipate more will follow and continue aggregating and reporting such data to the public and policymakers.</p>

                    <h3>HOSPITAL PRICE TRANSPARENCE</h3>
                   
                    <p>Hospital price transparency is not only here, but it's the future in Healthcare and cost related. One of the several reasons healthcare costs are so high is because cost information has been a closely guarded secret. After all, the last thing most hospitals want is to have there procedure/treatment prices blasted all over the Internet. And limiting competitor presence by acquiring other medical practices throughout geo-locations has been a big driver for many hospitals. Perhaps, the days of price gouging are over as we move forward to lowering costs throughout the healthcare landscape.

                      In a nutshell, since this blog post seventeen states and counting have implemented bills under new laws that would require states to provide user-friendly platforms allowing consumers to research the costs of healthcare services. These searchable services and the analysis of data vary from state to state. For example, some cost data will include chargemaster data, while other databases will include carrier reimbursement rate, provider charge, provider volumes regarding procedures or treatments etc. With many variables to consider, fine tuning this massive collection of healthcare price data will be key so that consumers can make better informed healthcare decisions.</p>
